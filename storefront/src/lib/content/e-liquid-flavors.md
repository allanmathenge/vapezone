## **PG and VG**
If you've ever browsed for e-liquid, you've definitely seen mysterious codes like "50/50" or "70% VG." While it might look like complex chemistry, understanding this simple code is the key to unlocking a much better vaping experience. E-liquid is primarily made up of two base liquids:

### **_PG - Propylene Glycol_**
- **What it is:** A thin, odourless liquid.
- **What it does:** PG is the flavour carrier. It provides that sharper, more intense flavour notes and delivers the "throat hit" that many former smokers crave. It creates a sensation similar to smoking a traditional cigarette.
- **The Vibe:** Crisp, sharp, and familiar.

### **_VG - Vegetable Glycerin_**
- **What it is:** A thicker, slightly sweet, natural liquid derived from vegetable oils.
- **What it does:** VG is all about the vapour. It produces those dense, billowy clouds that cloud chasers love. It also creates a much smoother feel on the throat compared to PG.
- **The Vibe:** Smooth, soft, and cloudy.

Getting the PG/VG ratio right means better flavour, satisfying vapour and a happy vape device. Get it wrong, and you might be dealing with leaks, dry hits or weak performance.

## **The Magic Ratio: How PG/VG Blends Change Your Vape**
Now, let's see what happens when we mix these two together in different proportions. The ratio is always displayed as PG% / VG% (e.g., 50/50).

### 1. The Standard (50% PG / 50% VG)
- **Experience:** A balanced throat hit, good flavour clarity, and a decent amount of vapour. It's the "all-rounder" of e-liquids.
- **Best For:** Beginner pod kits and most mouth-to-lung (MTL) devices. This thinner liquid wicks perfectly in small coils, preventing dry hits and leaks. It's the most common ratio for [Nicotine Salt E-liquids](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/nic-salts).

### 2. High PG (e.g., 60% PG / 40% VG)
- **Experience:** A very strong throat hit and intense flavour, but with less visible vapour. The liquid is very thin.
- **Best For:** Vapers who prioritize a strong throat sensation above all else. Use with caution, as thinner liquid can sometimes leak in tanks not designed for it.

### 3. High VG (e.g., 70% VG / 30% PG)
- **Experience:** Extremely smooth inhale, massive cloud production, and slightly muted flavour (because the thick vapour can overwhelm subtle notes). The liquid is viscous, like a thick syrup.
- **Best For:** Sub-Ohm devices and advanced vapers using powerful mods and rebuildable tanks (RDAs, RTAs). These devices have large wicking ports designed to handle thick liquid. Do not use high VG in a small pod kit—it will not wick properly and will give you a burnt coil.

### 4. Max VG (80% VG and above)
- **Experience:** The absolute smoothest inhale and maximum cloud potential. Flavour can be further muted.
- **Best For:** Cloud chasers and drippers using specialized RDA atomizers. Not for use in any standard tank or pod system.

## The Simple Cheat Sheet: What Ratio Should I Use?
- **[A Small Pod Kit ( Voopoo Argus, OXVA Xlim, etc)](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/pod-mods)**	- *50/50 PG/VG* - The thin liquid wicks easily in tiny coils, preventing dry hits.
- **A Pen or MTL Tank** - *50/50 or 60/40 VG/PG* - Balances great flavour and throat hit with reliable performance.
- **[A High-Power Sub-Ohm Tank](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/mods)** - *70% VG or Higher* - Your device can handle the thick liquid and needs it to produce massive clouds.

**The Golden Rule: Always match your e-liquid viscosity to your device's wicking ability.** Using thick liquid in a small pod is the most common cause of burnt coils!

### PG/VG and Nicotine: A Quick Note
- **Nicotine Salts:** Are almost always found in 50/50 ratios because they are designed for low-power pod systems.
- **Freebase Nicotine:** Can be found in any ratio, from 50/50 for MTL vapers to Max VG for sub-ohm cloud chasing.

### Find Your Perfect Match
Think of PG/VG as your e-liquid's personality. Do you want a sharp, flavourful punch (PG) or a smooth, cloudy experience (VG)?

Now that you speak the language, you can shop with confidence. Check your device’s manual or product description for its recommended ratio, or when in doubt, stick with a reliable 50/50 blend for a hassle-free vape.

## Step 1: Know Your Options - It's All About Pod Kits!

Forget the big, complicated mods you might have seen. For beginners, the answer is almost always a **[_Pod Kit_](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/pod-mods)**. They are designed to be **simple**, **affordable** and effective.

### Why a Pod Kit is Perfect for You:
- **Easy to Use:** Most are "draw-activated"—you just inhale. No buttons or complex settings.
- **Low Maintenance:** You just charge the device and replace the pre-made pods or coils. No messy refilling if you use pre-filled pods (though refillable ones are more common in Kenya).
- **Discreet & Portable:** They are small, lightweight and fit perfectly in your pocket.
- **Cost-Effective:** The initial device cost is low, making it a low-risk way to start your journey.
- **Kenyan Context:** Pod kits are widely available from reputable online stores and shops in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa. They are the most popular starter choice for a reason.

## Step 2: Key Features to Look For (Your Checklist)
When you're comparing pod kits, here are the most important things to consider:
- **Battery Life (mAh):** This determines how long your device will last between charges.
- **Good: 600mAh - 800mAh** (Lasts most of the day for an average user)
- **Better: 1000mAh+** (Will easily get you through a full day)
- **Kenya Tip:** With occasional power outages, a larger battery or a device with fast charging (USB-C) is a huge plus.

### Refillable vs. Pre-filled Pods:
- **[Refillable Pods (Recommended):](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/mods)** You buy bottles of e-liquid separately and fill the pod yourself. This gives you unlimited flavour choice and is much cheaper in the long run. This is the standard in Kenya.
- **Pre-filled Pods:** The pod comes filled with juice and you throw it away when empty. These are less common and more expensive over time.
- **Coil Compatibility:** If you choose a refillable device, you'll need to change the coil inside the pod every 1-2 weeks. Check that replacement coils for your specific device are readily available from Kenyan suppliers.
- **E-Liquid Compatibility:** Most pod kits work best with Nicotine Salt (Nic Salt) e-liquid. Nic Salts provide a smoother throat hit at higher strengths, making them ideal for satisfying cravings for new ex-smokers. They are perfectly suited for the low-power output of pod devices.

## Step 3: How to Match a Device to Your Needs
Ask yourself these questions:

- **_"I'm a heavy smoker (a pack a day). I need something strong."_**

**[Your Match:](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/pod-mods)** Look for a pod kit with a battery of 1000mAh or more. You'll want to use a higher strength Nic Salt e-liquid (e.g., 20mg) to ensure it satisfies your cravings. A device with a tighter draw that feels like a cigarette is ideal.

- **_"I'm a light/social smoker. I want something simple and discreet."_**

**[Your Match:](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/pod-devices)** A smaller, ultra-portable pod kit (600-800mAh) will be perfect. You can opt for a medium or lower nicotine strength (e.g., 10mg or 11mg Nic Salts).

- **_"I care about flavour and battery life more than a strong throat hit."_**

**[Your Match:](https://www.vapezone.co.ke/ke/collections/pod-devices)** Focus on devices known for good flavour production (look for reviews!). A larger battery is still a good idea. You might enjoy a wide range of fruity or dessert flavours with a medium nicotine strength.

### Your Beginner's Shopping List
Before you click "buy," make sure you have everything you need:

- **Pod Device Kit** (This usually includes the battery device and one or two empty pods).
- **Pack of Replacement Coils** (Check which coils your specific pod uses!).
- **Bottles of E-Liquid** (Nic Salt Recommended) in a flavour and strength you like.
- **A USB Charging Cable** (usually included with the device).

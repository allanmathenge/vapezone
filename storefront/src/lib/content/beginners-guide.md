## What Exactly Is Vaping?

At its simplest, vaping is the act of inhaling a vapour created by an electronic device (an e-cigarette or vape). The device heats a liquid (called e-liquid or vape juice) into a mist, which you then inhale.

No tobacco, no combustion, no smoke. Just vapour. The key? You get the experience you're looking for, but without the smoke or ash.

## Understanding E-Liquid (The "Juice")
This is what creates the flavour and vapour.

**What's in it?** E-liquid is typically made from just a few ingredients:

- **Vegetable Glycerin (VG) & Propylene Glycol (PG):** These are the bases. **VG** is thick and produces smooth, dense clouds. **PG** is thin and carries flavour well and provides a "throat hit."
- **Flavourings:** Food-grade flavours that make vaping taste great—from mango and strawberry to coffee and dessert.
- **Nicotine (Optional):** This is where you can control your intake. It comes in different strengths.

### Choosing Your Nicotine Strength:
- **High Strength (e.g., 20mg/ml Salt Nicotine):** Best for heavy smokers who need a strong, satisfying hit. Salt nicotine is particularly smooth at high strengths.
- **Medium Strength (e.g., 6-12mg/ml):** Good for light to average smokers.
- **Low Strength (e.g., 3mg/ml) or Zero Nicotine:** For those who have reduced their intake or just enjoy the flavour and habit.
- **Beginner's Tip:** If you're a former smoker, don't start too low. A stronger nicotine e-liquid (like a 20mg salt nic) will satisfy your cravings better and make the switch from smoking much easier.

## How to Vape – It’s Not Like Smoking
This is the most common beginner mistake! Smoking involves quick, hard puffs. Vaping is different.
- **Mouth-to-Lung (MTL):** This is the style for beginners. You draw the vapour into your mouth first (like sipping a thick milkshake), hold it for a second, and then inhale it into your lungs. This is exactly how you smoke a cigarette and is the best way to use pod and pen kits.
- **Direct-to-Lung (DTL):** This is for advanced users with big devices. You inhale the vapour directly into your lungs in one long, deep breath, like taking a deep breath of air.
- **Beginner's Tip:** Use the Mouth-to-Lung (MTL) method. Take slow, gentle, and longer drags than you would with a cigarette.

## Basic Maintenance (Keeping It Running Smoothly)
*A little care goes a long way:*
- **Charge It:** Keep your device charged. Most use a simple USB-C cable.
- **Prime Your Coils:** If you have a refillable device, before you use a new coil, add a few drops of e-liquid directly onto the cotton wick inside and let it sit in a full tank for 5 minutes. This prevents a nasty "burnt hit."
- **Keep It Clean:** Occasionally wipe down the mouthpiece and the outside of your device to avoid pocket lint and dust getting into the contacts.

## Your First Vape Setup: A Quick Checklist
- **The Device:** One vape kit (we recommend a Pod Kit).
- **The E-Liquid:** One bottle of e-liquid in a flavour that appeals to you. Choose a nicotine strength based on your previous smoking habits.
- **Extra Pods/Coils:** Coils are consumable and need replacing every 1-2 weeks. Grab a pack so you’re not caught out.
- **A Charging Cable:** Usually included in the kit.

## You’re Ready to Go!
Remember, the goal is to find what works for you. It might take trying a couple of different flavours or nicotine strengths to find your perfect match. That’s all part of the journey.
The most important thing? You’ve taken the first step by educating yourself. Well done.

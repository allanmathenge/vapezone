## **Why Do Vape Pods Leak?**

**Vape pods leak when e-liquid finds a way out of its designated chamber and into the airflow path or battery connection**. This usually happens due to changes in pressure, temperature, or a simple failure of a seal.

## **Let’s diagnose and fix the five most common culprits.**

### **Fix 1:** Check Your E-Liquid & Overfilling
- **The Problem:** You’ve overfilled the pod or are using the wrong e-liquid consistency.
- **The Solution:** **_Don't Overfill:_** Most pods have a "MAX" fill line for a reason. E-liquid needs empty space to create pressure and wick properly. If you fill it to the very top, you force liquid into the coil and airflow system. Always leave a tiny air bubble at the top.
- **Check Your PG/VG Ratio:** E-liquids with a **high** Propylene Glycol (PG) content are thinner (like water). E-liquids with high Vegetable Glycerin (VG) are **thicker** (like syrup). **Most pod systems are designed for a 50/50 PG/VG ratio** or higher VG (e.g., 60% VG/40% PG). Using a thin, high-PG liquid in a pod not designed for it can cause leaking.
- _**Pro Tip:** If you're having persistent leaks, try switching to a slightly thicker e-liquid with higher VG._

### **Fix 2:** A Faulty or Worn-Out Coil/Pod
- **The Problem:** The coil inside your pod is the heart of the system. Once it gets old or burns out, it can’t vaporize liquid effectively, leading to flooding and leaking.
- **The Solution:** **_Change Your Pod/Coil:_** If your **vapour tastes burnt** or the leak started around the same time your flavour diminished, it’s time for a **replacement**. A fresh coil will have clean cotton that effectively absorbs and vaporizes the e-liquid.
- _**Pro Tip:** Always prime a new coil. Before inserting a new pod or coil, add a few drops of e-liquid directly onto the cotton wick holes. Let it sit in a filled tank for 5-10 minutes before use. This prevents the cotton from burning, which can ruin the coil and cause leaks._

### **Fix 3:** Keep It upright! (Gravity is Real)
- **The Problem:** You leave your vape lying on its side for long periods.
- **The Solution:** **_Store It Upright:_** Just like a pen, your vape pod is designed to be stored upright. Laying it down on its side can cause e-liquid to slowly seep into the airflow chamber. **Make a habit of standing your device up when you’re not using it.**

### **Fix 4:** Temperature & Pressure Changes
- **The Problem:** Extreme heat (like leaving your vape in a hot car) causes the e-liquid to become thinner and expand. Similarly, big changes in air pressure (like on an airplane) can force liquid out.
- **The Solution:** **_Avoid Extreme Temperatures:_** Don’t leave your device in direct sunlight or a hot car.
- **For Air Travel:** Always remove your pod from the device and store it in a sealed plastic bag before you board a plane. The pressure change in the cargo hold will almost guaranteed cause a major leak otherwise.

### **Fix 5:** Cleanliness is Key
- **The Problem:** A small amount of e-liquid has pooled in the connection between the pod and the battery, interfering with the connection and causing gurgling or more leaking.
- **The Solution:** **_Perform Routine Maintenance:_** Power off your device. Remove the pod. Take a cotton bud or a paper towel and thoroughly dry the inside of the battery compartment where the pod connects, as well as the bottom of the pod itself. A clean connection is a happy connection.

## The Quick-Leak Emergency Fix
If your pod is gurgling and flooding right now, here’s how to stop it immediately:
1. Remove the pod from the battery.
2. Wrap a paper towel around the mouthpiece.
3. Flick the pod downwards (like flicking a thermometer) several times over a sink or trash can. This will force excess liquid out of the central chimney and onto the paper towel.
4. Wipe the bottom of the pod clean and reattach it to the device.
This should clear the flood and get you back to vaping.

## When All Else Fails...
If you’ve tried all these fixes and your pod is still leaking, you might have a defective pod. Even the best brands have the occasional dud. The best course of action is to simply replace it with a new one.

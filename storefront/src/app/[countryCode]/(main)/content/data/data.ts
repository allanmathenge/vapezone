    excerpt: "\n\n## What Exactly Is Vaping?\n\nAt its core, vaping is the act of inhaling a vapor created by an electronic device that heats up a special liquid. Think of it as a high-tech, customizable alternative to traditional smoking. The key? You get the experience you're looking for, but without the smoke, ash, or overwhelming smell.\n\n### Getting to Know Your Device\n\nMost vapes, also called kits, mods, or pods, are made up of a few key parts. Once you know what they do, it all starts to make sense.\n - **The Battery:**\n This is the power source. It's usually built into the device and is rechargeable via USB. Battery life varies â€“ smaller devices might need a daily charge, while bigger ones can last a couple of days.",
